# Basics of electronic warfare

Electromagnetic warfare or electronic warfare(EW) is warfare involving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM spectrum) to control the spectrum, attack an enemy, or impede enemy operations.

**Visual representation of how Electromagnetic spectrum propagates**
![alt text](<../image/electromagneticspectrum.png>)

Electronic warfare consists of three major subdivisions:

  * electronic  attack (EA)

  * electronic  protection (EP)

  * electronic  warfare support (ES).

# **1.Electronic Attack (EA)**

Electronic Attack involves using electromagnetic energy, directed energy, or anti-radiation weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying enemy combat capability. EA includes jamming enemy radar and communication systems, using decoys, and deploying anti-radiation missiles.

# **2\. Electronic Protection (EP)**

Electronic Protection refers to actions taken to protect friendly forces from the effects of electronic warfare. This includes measures to ensure the effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum by friendly forces, such as frequency hopping, electronic shielding, and implementing countermeasures to mitigate the impact of enemy jamming and interference.

# **3\. Electronic Warfare Support (ES)**

Electronic Warfare Support involves searching for, intercepting, identifying, and locating sources of intentional and unintentional radiated electromagnetic energy for the purpose of immediate threat recognition. This information is then used to support immediate decisions involving threat avoidance, targeting, and other tactical actions. ES includes activities like signal intelligence (SIGINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), and communications intelligence (COMINT).

This project mainly focuses on **electronic warfare support measures**(ESM)

# **Parameters calculated by radar**

Radars calculate several key parameters to detect, locate, and identify objects. These parameters include:

**1\. Range (Distance):**

The distance to the target, calculated by measuring the time delay between the transmission of a radar pulse and the reception of the echo.

**2\. Range Rate (Radial Velocity):**

The relative speed at which the target is moving towards or away from the radar, determined using the Doppler effect.  
**3\. Azimuth (Bearing):**

The horizontal angle or direction of the target relative to the radar, often measured in degrees from a reference direction, usually true north.

**4\. Elevation (Tilt or Pitch Angle):**

The vertical angle between the radar and the target, indicating the target's height relative to the radar's position.

**5\. Angle of Arrival (AOA):**

The angle at which the received signal arrives at the radar, used to determine the direction of the target.

**6\. Target Size (Radar Cross Section \- RCS):**

An estimate of the target's size, determined by the strength of the reflected signal.

**7\. Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI):**

The time interval between successive radar pulses, which can affect the radar’s ability to measure range accurately.

**8\. Pulse Width (PW):**

The duration of the transmitted radar pulse, which affects the radar's range resolution.

**9\. Signal Strength (Amplitude):**

The power level of the received echo signal, which can provide information about the target's size and material properties.

**10\. Frequency Shift (Doppler Shift):**
The change in frequency of the returned signal due to the relative motion between the radar and the target, used to calculate the radial velocity.

**11\. Clutter and Noise Level:**

The levels of unwanted reflections and interference, which need to be minimized or filtered out to accurately detect and track targets.

These parameters are essential for effective radar operation, enabling accurate detection, tracking, and identification of objects in the radar's field of view.

# **Frequency Letter Bands**
![alt text](</image/spectrumband.png>)

The marked frequency bands are the frequency bands that are used in Electronic warfare. The dataset contains the frequency value ranges from \>500MHz to 18GHz.

# **How radar calculates the range?**
![alt text](</image/radarwork.png>)

**Diagram shows the round trip of radar signal**

Range is the distance from the radar site to the target measured along the line of sight.

c=2R/t

The factor of two in the equation comes from the observation that the radar pulse must travel to the target and back before detection, or twice the range.

R=c.t / 2

Where c= 3·108 m/s, is the speed of light at which all electromagnetic waves propagate.

If the respective running time t is known, then the distance R between a target and the radar set can be calculated by using this equation.

# **Doppler Radar**

A Doppler radar is a specialized radar that uses the [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler\_effect) to produce [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity) data about objects at a distance. It does this by bouncing a [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave) signal off a desired target and analyzing how the object's motion has altered the frequency of the returned signal. This variation gives direct and highly accurate measurements of the [radial](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/radial) component of a target's velocity relative to the radar. The term applies to radar systems in many domains like aviation, police radar detectors, navigation, meteorology, etc.

**∆f  \=	2 Vr cosθ** 
 \-----------  
**λ**

**Δf**: This is the Doppler shift in frequency. The valve of f have both positive as well as negative values . 

**Vr​**: This is the radial velocity of the target relative to the radar.

**θ**: This is the angle between the direction of the target's motion and 
the line of sight from the radar to the target. The cosθ\\cos \\thetacosθ term accounts for the fact that only the component of the target's velocity along the line of sight affects the Doppler shift. 

**λ**: This is the wavelength of the radar signal. The positive value of frequency tells that the target is approaching the radar , whereas the negative value tells that the target is moving away from the radar.

# **Types of emitter**

## **1)Continuous wave (CW) emitter**
![](</image/continuouswave.png>)

**Amplitude:** The signal maintains a constant amplitude.

**Frequency:** The frequency remains constant over time.

**Continuous:** The signal is continuous with no interruptions.

## **2)Pulsed Emitter**
![alt text](</image/pulseemitterwave.png>)

**Amplitude:** The signal has bursts of high amplitude.

**Pulse Duration:** Each pulse has a specific duration, followed by a period of no transmission (off time).  
**Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI):** The interval between the start of one pulse and the start of the next pulse.  
**Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF):** The frequency at which the pulses are transmitted.

# **Modulation**

Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a carrier signal (such as amplitude, frequency, or phase) in accordance with a data signal. This is used in communication systems to transmit information over various media. The primary goal of modulation is to adapt the baseband signal to be suitable for transmission over a given channel.

## **Types of Modulation**

**1. Amplitude Modulation (AM)**

   The amplitude of the carrier wave changes according to the information signal. The frequency and phase remain constant.

**2. Frequency Modulation (FM)**

   The frequency of the carrier wave changes according to the information signal.The amplitude and phase remain constant.

**3. Phase Modulation (PM)**

   The phase of the carrier wave changes according to the information signal.The amplitude and frequency remain constant.

   ![alt text](</image/typesofsignal.png>)

# **Types of Emitters based on PRI**

![alt text](</image/typeofpri.png>)

# **The parameters that the Dataset contains**

* Amplitude/power

* Frequency

* Pulse width

* Angle of Arrival

* Time of Arrival

* Modulation of pulse

Note: with these given parameters , the derived parameters like PRI are derived.

# **Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI)**

Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI) is the time interval between the beginnings of two consecutive pulses in a pulsed radar system.Typically measured in microseconds (µs) or milliseconds (ms). Determines the maximum unambiguous range of the radar. Longer PRI allows detection of targets at greater distances but reduces the rate of target updates.

# **Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)**

Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) is the number of pulses transmitted per second by a radar system.PRF is the inverse of PRI.

PRF=1 / PRI

Higher PRF allows for better target resolution and faster update rates but can introduce range ambiguities.

# **Duty Cycle**

Duty cycle is the fraction of time that a radar system is actively transmitting a pulse, expressed as a percentage.Duty cycle tells the percentage of time the radar is actively transmitting. Higher duty cycles improve detection capabilities but increase power usage and thermal load.  
**Duty Cycle= (pulsewidth/PRI) \* 100**

**Pulse width:** Duration of the pulse transmission.

# **Different Types of Radars and Their Functions**

### **2\. Surprise in the Battlefield**

Who will win the war what are the qualities required for winning the war

**Surprise attack \-** According to Klausewitz(Prussian general and military theorist), the strategic surprise appears in war as a whole, and the tactical one – on the field of battle. There, the strategic one is more important for the achievement of victory, because a strategic advance, unexpected by the enemy, may lead to victory in the entire war.

* **Achieving Surprise:**  
* **Speed**: Rapid manoeuvring is critical in surprising the enemy. AI algorithms optimise flight paths for maximum speed.  
* **Stealth**: Advanced stealth technology and AI-driven tactics help in hiding aircraft from enemy radar.  
* **Early Detection**: AI-enhanced sensors enable early detection of enemy units, providing a tactical advantage.  
* **Swift Return**: Strategies for quick return to base after a mission to maintain operational readiness.

* **Electronic Countermeasures (ECM)**: Techniques to disrupt enemy radar.  
* **Electronic Counter-Countermeasures (ECCM)**: Methods to protect friendly radar from enemy ECM.

### **5.Real-Time Battle Scenarios**:

In a real combat mission, many tasks could be assigned to an aircraft: intercepting enemy fighters or bombers, dogfighting, or strike missions against ground targets. For instance, in an air-to-air mission, the radar detects an enemy plane at distance. After engagement, the pilot flies to gain a tactical advantage, manuevering to bring the aircraft behind the enemy for a clear shot. Advanced modern aircraft come with beyond-visual-range missiles that allow them to attack a target from a distance; however, close combat, or dogfighting, still requires brightly skillful maneuvering.

**Real-Time Battle Scenarios:**

* Integration of ECM and ECCM in combat operations.  
* Real-time examples showcasing the effectiveness of these systems.

### **6.Duration of real combat**

* Typically a aircraft combat missions does not take few minutes only it's all based on the mission  
* In world war time mission can extend with help of in-air fueling  
* B-2 (US Bomber) missions often lasted for more than eight hours and struck at targets deep within enemy territory. Because of their long-range capability

[Duration of real  combat](https://online.norwich.edu/online/about/resource-library/10-largest-air-air-battles-military-history)

###            Typical Mission Duration:

* **Fighter Missions:** Generally range from 1 to 2 hours but can extend to several hours with refuelling.  
* **Bomber Missions:** These can last several hours, particularly for long-range strategic bombing runs.  
* **Surveillance and Patrol:** Often last 4-8 hours or more, depending on the area covered and mission requirements.

##### **7\. Why we need EW protection**
![alt text](</image/sensorinaircraft.png>)

**EW Protection Necessity:**

* Electronic warfare can also be considered as an invisible war.  
* We need electronic warfare support and protection for a few minutes only.

## **8.Enemy Detection Methods**

How do jet pilots confirm whether it's an enemy or friend at night ?

In all military aircrafts there is a system known as IFF ( Identification of Friend or Foe) this system uses some sort of radio waves or radar waves in order to contact the approaching aircraft and confirm if it's a friend or enemy/ unknown aircraft. This system is linked to radar systems and other sensors so it can send confirmation code. If desired response is received then the aircraft is friendly and if not then it's an enemy / unknown aircraft.

**There are some sort of techniques also used by adversaries to detect friendly aircraft:**

* Radar system  
* ELINT-(electronic intelligence)  
* IRST-(infrared search track)

# Battle and ConOps(Concept of Operations)

**Definition and Purpose:**  
A generally accepted concept of operations typically describes any vision, goals, and operational strategies concerning a system or project. It gives details on how the system is intended to function, the tasks it is required to accomplish, and under which conditions it shall operate. On the lowest level of its usage, CONOPS explains exactly how the system is intended to be used and operated, hence communicating the operational framework in which a system is going to execute its mission to all stakeholders.  
**9\. IN BATTLE:**  
**Formations**—formation flying—are one of the most basic precepts of military flying. They are useful in enhancing situational awareness, operational efficiency, force protection, and psychological impact while, overall, promoting safety. This explains its continued use in various military operations across the world.  
Operations in formation, preplanned, are executed according to plan.  
![alt text](</image/formation.png>)

* **Flying low** \-  flying low offers significant tactical advantages by reducing detectability, evading enemy defenses, and increasing the accuracy of strikes, thereby playing a vital role in modern combat operations.  
  ![!\[\]\[image3\]  ](</image/lowfly.png>)
  Fly low to avoid detection by surface-to-air missiles  
    
  **EW system saves pilots** \- Any modern military aircraft is equipped with an Electronic Warfare (EW) system. This is one of the most important systems for aircrew survival in combat. Here are the key ways that EW systems save pilots:  
  **Threat Detection and Identification:**  
  **Radar Warning Receivers:** Most EW systems are fitted with radar warning receivers that detect radar emissions from enemy air defense systems and aircraft. The receivers warn the pilot of the potential or actual threat, characterised by a missile-guidance tone or the 'break-lock' tone of hostile radar, hence allowing an opportunity to undertake evasive manoeuvres or dedicate countermeasures.  
  **Electronic Counter Measures:**  
  Jamming: Systems that can emit signals to interfere with enemy radar, virtually "blinding" it and rendering it unable to track or target the aircraft accurately. This can make all the difference between escaping a radar-guided missile or just evading detection in general.

### **10.Real-world Examples and Sources**

* **F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II**: These advanced fighter jets are equipped with sophisticated EW suites that include RWRs, jamming capabilities, and IRCM systems, showcasing the integration and effectiveness of EW in modern combat aircraft .  
* **Operation Desert Storm**: During this conflict, coalition aircraft used EW extensively to neutralise Iraqi air defences, demonstrating the life-saving capabilities of EW in real-world scenarios . 

* ### **11\. Chaffs and Flares: The Last Line of Defense for a Flying Pilot**

* Of all the countermeasures that any flying military pilot would fly with, chaff and flares are the most important to avoid enemy missiles and keep oneself safe during combat. These devices are often dubbed a last line of defense when an aircraft comes under direct threat from missile attacks.

* **Chaff:** Chaff comprises a number of small thin pieces of aluminium or metallic-coated fibres. These pieces scatter in the air and form a cloud that reflects radar signals when it is deployed.  
* Chaff is normally released in bursts, and its effectiveness is entirely dependent on the timing and pattern of the release. Pilots mostly drop chaff in coordination with evasive manoeuvres for maximum effect.  
    
* **Flares :** Flares are pyrotechnic devices that burn at high temperatures and emit high-intensity IR radiation.  
* Flares are usually fired in patterns to optimum effect. Flares might be fired as the pilot is executing a hard turn or climb to further muddy the missile's tracking system. The combination of the high heat and aircraft maneuvering together makes for an unlikely scenario whereby the missile holds its lock on the aircraft.

[Surface air missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air\_missile)

**11\. Operational requirement**

**Two broad requirements**

**Detect the enemy as early as possible:** Aerial supremacy, also referred to as air superiority, is the degree of control of the air power in conflict exercised by one side over opposing forces. The different degrees and types of control of the air in aerial warfare number in the dozens. Control of the air is the aerial equivalent of command of the sea.

**Enemy radar jamming:** Radar jamming, together with electronic 'deception, is intended to confuse the radar operation with the introduction of incorrect information and noise. This is an intentional emission of radio-frequency energy. There are two types of radar jamming: electronic and mechanical.

**–Electronic jamming** is part of the warfare operation where jammers radiate sundry signals toward the radar of the enemy so that Signals interfere with its functionality. Repeater and noise techniques are the two most common important techniques used in this procedure.

**– Mechanical jamming**, you need tools that can rereflect or reflect their radar's energy back to it. Because of this technique, it gives the appearance that there is a false target. Corner reflectors, decoys, and chaff are three main components of tools that assist in mechanical jamming.

               

Those two requirements need the following chain requirement                                                                                                                                                       

### **Operational Requirements for Effective Electronic Warfare (EW)**

**Overview of Broad Operational Needs**

Effective Electronic Warfare is one of the prime requirements of air superiority and protection of own forces while conducting combat operations. The basic operational needs for effective EW are to detect, analyze, and counter enemy electronic systems while having a like set capable of counter-counter measures to ensure friendly systems protection. Advanced technologies enhance these capabilities to ensure real-time decision-making and strategic advantages through AI and integration.

Chain of Requirements

**1\. Detection**

Basically, the first step of EW operations is the detection of enemy aircraft and related electronic systems. This includes advanced methods and technologies of detection that can enter into service and identify potential threats at a very early stage.

**2\. Clustering**

After the detection of signals, clustering techniques are applied to group these signals in such a way as to give meaning to effective analysis and understanding. Effective clustering techniques mean that a system could identify multiple targets and their behaviours. Key approaches include:

**Machine Learning Algorithms:** Signals are classified under various unsupervised learning techniques, such as K-means clustering, in an unsupervised manner.

**Example:** Clustering algorithms in ELINT systems group radar signals to highlight which are unique radar systems and how they are being operated.

**3\. Generation of Radar Track**s

For assessing the adversary's movements and taking appropriate decisions, accurate radar tracks are needed. Raw radar data has to be processed and filtered to present coherent tracks.

**4\. Radar Classification**

Radar classification refers to the process of identification of the type of radar and signal used. It's simply the form by which differentiation amongst a wide variety of radar types and signals is done so as to identify the generic nature and capabilities of enemy systems. Effective classification involves:

**Analysis of signals:** This is an examination into the characteristics of the radar signals, pulse width, repetition frequency, modulation type.

**5\. Precise Localization**

A correct location of enemy assets is necessary for targeting and engagement. Precise localization involves:

• **Triangulation:** This is a process of determining the location of the source of a signal by using multiple sensors and calculating the time difference of its arrival.

**• Geolocation Algorithms**: Complicated mathematical models used to calculate the exact position of a target.

• **Integration with GIS**: localization data integrated into geographic information systems can help in creating a detailed situational awareness.

**6\. Jamming the Rada**r

This is yet another important aspect of EW. The techniques of jamming are:

**Noise Jamming:** A transmission of high-power noise with the purpose of saturating the enemy radar receiver.

**Deceptive Jamming**: The transmission of false signals with the view of misleading the enemy radar on target speed, position, and movements.

**Barrage Jamming**: This covers a wide frequency band to block the use of radar equipment of enemies.

Example: EA-18G Growler aircraft against enemy radar and communication devices using noise and deceptive jammers.

**7\. Identification of Radar**

The ability to identify specific radar models and hence their potential capability accurately is extremely useful for EW operations.I

### **Conclusion**

This document provides a detailed exploration of Combat EW ConOps and the operational requirements essential for modern military operations. The integration of AI in EW enhances the effectiveness and protection of combat aircraft, ensuring mission success.
